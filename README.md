This program is a 'function calculator'. You start with 2 built-in functions,
and make your way up from there. Built in functions are: 1.ln(x), 2.sin(x).
You can use the calculator with the following commands:
-the commands are the 3/4 letter words before the brackets in each line(e.g poly(nomial)..)-
1. eval(uate) funcNum, xValue: evaluates func. num (funcNum) in the menu with inserted X.
2. poly(nom) n c0 c1 ...cn-1: inserts a new polynomial when 'n' is the highest degree and 
c's are the coefficients.
3. mul(tiply) funcNum1 funcNum2: multiplies the 2 wanted functions and adds the new func to the list.
4. add funcNum1 funcNum2: adds between the 2 wanted functions and adds the new func to the list.
5. comp(osite) funcNum1 funcNum2: composites 2 wanted functions and adds the new func to the list.
(let f(), g() functions. comp f(), g() will output f(g())).
6. log N funcNum: adds log N (funcNum) to the functions list.
7. del(ete) funcNum: deletes the function 'funcNum' from the list.
8. help: shows 'help' screen.
9. exit: prints 'Goodbye' and exits the program.

The input varies between every command. Input is specified on every line of the commands.
The output will always be the function name with the result.
